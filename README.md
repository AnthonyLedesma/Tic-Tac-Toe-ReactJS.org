If You Prefer to Write Code in Your Editor:

If you want to do it, here are the steps to follow:

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
Follow the installation instructions to create a new project.

    npm install -g create-react-app
    create-react-app my-app
    
Delete all files in the src/ folder of the new project (donâ€™t delete the folder, just its contents).

    cd my-app
    rm -f src/*
    
Add a file named index.css in the src/ folder with [this CSS code.](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0100)

Add a file named index.js in the src/ folder with [this JS code.](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010)

Add these three lines to the top of index.js in the src/ folder:

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import './index.css';
    
Now if you run npm start in the project folder and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser, you should see an empty tic-tac-toe field.
